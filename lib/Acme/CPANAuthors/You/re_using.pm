=head1 NAME

Acme::CPANAuthors::You::re_using - We are the CPAN authors that have written the modules installed on your perl!

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.03

 $VERSION = '0.03';
}

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::CPANAuthors;

    my $authors = Acme::CPANAuthors->new("You're_using");
    print $authors->name($_) . " ($_)\n" for $authors->id;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module builds an L<Acme::CPANAuthors> class by listing all the modules that are installed on the current C<perl> and then retrieving the name and the PAUSE id of their corresponding authors.

It may take some time to load since it has to search all the directory trees given by your C<@INC> for modules, but also to get and parse CPAN indexes.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 C<register>

Fetches and registers the names into L<Acme::CPANAuthors::Register>.
This function is automatically called when you C<use> this module, unless you have set the package variable C<$Acme::CPANAuthors::You're_using::SKIP> to true beforehand.
