0.04    2011-08-24 23:10 UTC
        + Chg : The module now uses File::Find and Module::Metadata to collect
                all the modules installed in your system.
                ExtUtils::Installed is no longer needed.
        + Chg : die() is called instead of croak() for internal errors.
                Carp is no longer needed.
        + Fix : Update the Parse::CPAN::Packages' author id test, since
                Acme::CPANAuthors does not depend on it anymore.
        + Upd : Acme::CPANAuthors dependency bumped to 0.16.

0.03    2010-01-03 10:10 UTC
        + Fix : Stop skipping t/10-base.t when Acme::CPANAuthors throw an
                unrelated warning.

                Acme::CPANAuthors.

        + Doc : Misc. improvements.
        + Fix : Missing directory trees to search for installed modules.
        + Fix : 'Perl' shouldn't been counted as a proper module.
        + Tst : Actually register the names in only one test. This divides the
                test suite run time by three.
        + Tst : Test that some of our deps were correctly discovered.
