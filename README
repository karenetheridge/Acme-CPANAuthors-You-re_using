NAME
    Acme::CPANAuthors::You::re_using - We are the CPAN authors that have
    written the modules installed on your perl!

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::CPANAuthors;

        my $authors = Acme::CPANAuthors->new("You're_using");
        print $authors->name($_) . " ($_)\n" for $authors->id;

DESCRIPTION
    This module builds an Acme::CPANAuthors class by listing all the modules
    that are installed on the current "perl" and then retrieving the name
    and the PAUSE id of their corresponding authors.

    It may take some time to load since it has to search all the directory
    trees given by your @INC for modules, but also to get and parse CPAN
    indexes.

FUNCTIONS
  "register"
    Fetches and registers the names into Acme::CPANAuthors::Register. This
    function is automatically called when you "use" this module, unless you
    have set the package variable $Acme::CPANAuthors::You're_using::SKIP to
    true beforehand.

DEPENDENCIES
    Carp, ExtUtils::Installed, Acme::CPANAuthors.

SEE ALSO
    All others "Acme::CPANAuthors::*" modules.
