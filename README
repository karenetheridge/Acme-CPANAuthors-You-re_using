NAME
    Acme::CPANAuthors::You::re_using - We are the CPAN authors that have
    written the modules installed for this perl.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::CPANAuthors;

        my $authors = Acme::CPANAuthors->new("You're_using");
        print $authors->name($_) . " ($_)\n" for $authors->id;

DESCRIPTION
    This module builds an Acme::CPANAuthors class by looking for all
    installed modules for the current "perl" and then retrieving theirs
    authors' name and PAUSE id.

    It may take some time to load since it has to get CPAN indexes at
    "BEGIN" time.

DEPENDENCIES
    Carp, ExtUtils::Installed, Acme::CPANAuthors.

SEE ALSO
    All others "Acme::CPANAuthors::*" modules.
